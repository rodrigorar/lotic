# Domain Error

## Status

ACCEPTED - 2022-11-20

## Context

We need some sort of way to deal with errors in a generic but complete way. 

## Decision

Since we will be using Exception Tunneling for the basis of our error handling, 
the base errors in the Domain will be exceptions that can then be extended for more
specific cases. 

## Consequences

**Positive:**

* Exception Tunneling is a simple way of dealing with errors. 
* The code in the use cases will be only the business rule that we defined. 

**Negative:**

* All the error handling code will be hidden. 
* It is easier to forget to deal with certain errors because they are not explicit.
