# Maybe Struct

## Status

ACCEPTED - 2022-11-20

## Context

Returning None or null is undesirable in projects, because that way, and especially
with pythons dynamically typed design it is easy to make mistakes and trey to call
a None object. 

## Decision

Introduce a new util for the notion of Option or Maybe to guaranty that we do not 
deal directly with None types and instead if there is no object we will have a Maybe
struct that is empty. 

**Note:** We will try to make Maybe as close to a monad as possible. 

## Consequences


**Positive:**

* Allows to deal with None type in a structured way
* Makes explicit that a method/function may return a None value. 

**Negative:**

* Make the code more complex, and harder to deal with.
