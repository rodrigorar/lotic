# Clean Architecture

## Status

ACCEPTED - 2022-11-13

## Context

We are trying to create a good architecture that allows us to be flexible in the future,
also we don't want to be locked in to any specific library or infrastructure, as 
such we decided to go with the Clean Architecture design for the application. 


## Decision

To use Clean Architecture for the base of the project design, dividing the code into
3 major blocks (Domain, Application, Infrastructure), and where Domain as no dependency
on anything else, not even libraries, application and infrastructure will depend on 
Domain and Infrastructure is the only block that will have dependency on third party
code. Also for the Domain design and organization we will try to base our decisions
with Domain Driven Design in mind. 

## Consequences

Although this architecture does gives flexibility in changing modules out or changing
dependency on third party code, it does come at the cost of complexity, meaning
that the architecture of the application is way more complex than it would be
otherwise.
