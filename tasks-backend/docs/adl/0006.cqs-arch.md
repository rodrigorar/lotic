# CQS Architecture Pattern

## Status

ACCEPTED - 2023-05-09

## Context

This section describes what made us make this decision and all the factors involved, 
technological, political, social or project local. This section should describe facts 
in a value neutral language. 

We decided to proceed with the CQS Architecture Pattern because it makes
the operations more clear and it separate between the two major operation groups
Commands and Queries. All it prevent UseCases from doing everything, creating
stuff, return values, etc. 

## Decision

All UseCases will be migrated to use two types of UseCases, Commands and Queries,
and a UseCase either executes an action, or returns values to a client. 

## Consequences

The consequences of this pattern is that each use case is smaller and more
objective but also it might make the operations more costly because more than one
call might have to be done in order the have the outcome we desire.
