# DTO Translators

## Status

ACCEPTED - 2022-11-20 

## Context

We need to translate DTOs to Entities and vice-versa, and in order to have a better 
design this translation mechanism should be standardized. 

## Decision

We decided to create a base class with the input and output translator methods, like
the example bellow: 

    class DTOTranslator:
        
        def to_entity(self):
            # Code that transforms the DTO into an entity.

        def from_entity(self, entity):
            # Code that transforms from and entity into a DTO.

All DTOs should extend from this base class and implement both **to_entity** and
**from_entity**  with the specific behaviour necessary to transform a DTO to an
entity and vice-versa. 

## Consequences

**Positive**

* Standardized way to implement and call DTO <-> Entity transformation. 
* Possibility to abstract the transformations in a standardized way. 

**Negative**

* Uses inheritance to implement the factories, which is less than ideal.
