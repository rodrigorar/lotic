# Use Hatch as the dependency manager

## Status

ACCEPTED - 2022-11-05

## Context

The system needs a proper way to manage dependencies, and as so we needed a tool that would
provide that management easily for us. 

## Decision

In the context of setting up the backend of the project, facing 
the need to manage our dependencies efficiently we decided for 
Hatch and neglected venv, pipenv, etc, to achieve 
a better structure for the dependency management by abstracting the management of
evironments, dependencies, etc, accepting that Hatch does not appear to be a very
mainstream tool and that can cause issues in the future if the tool develoment
stagnates or its maintenance is dropped entirely.

## Consequences

What are the benefits of applying this ADR? What are is drawbacks? This should be the main questions answered 
in this section. 

**Benefits**
* Easy dependency management
* Easy virtual environment management
* Good CI/CD integration
* Well strcutured
* Similar to more astablished Dependency Management tools (Maven, Gradle)

**Drawbacks**
* More complex than venv or pipenv
* Not widely used
